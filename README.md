## Amazon React

The Amazon React is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, modern web applications using popular technologies for both frontend and backend development.

### Features
- **Frontend Development**: The application’s frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Vite was used as the build tool to optimize the development process and ensure high performance.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and account management were implemented using Firebase, ensuring secure and seamless login functionality.
- **Backend Development**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling all API requests, user sessions, and server-side logic effectively.
- **Database Integration**: Firebase Realtime Database was utilized for storing and managing application data.
- **Deployment**: The application is hosted on Netlify, providing fast and reliable access.
